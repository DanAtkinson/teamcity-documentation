[//]: # (title: SSH Upload)

The _SSH Upload_ build runner allows uploading files/directories via SSH (using SCP or SFTP protocols).

The settings common for all runners are described in [Configuring Build Steps](configuring-build-steps.md); this page details the SSH Deployer settings.

The fields below support [parameter references](predefined-build-parameters.md): any text between percentage signs (`%`) is considered a reference to a property by TeamCity. To prevent TeamCity from treating the text in the percentage signs as reference to a property, use two percentage signs to escape them: for example, if you want to pass `%\Y%m%\d%H%\M%S` into the build, change it to `%\%Y%\%m%\%d%\%H%\%M%\%S`.

<warning>

When strong cryptography is required by the server that receives the deployment, build agents need to have [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) ](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy installed on the JRE.

Select an authentication method:

* __Uploaded key__ — uses the key(s) uploaded to the project. See [SSH Keys Management](ssh-keys-management.md) for details.
* __Default private key__ — performs private key authentication using the `~/.ssh/config` settings or, if no settings file exists, using the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` private key file.
* __Custom private key__ — performs private key authentication using the specified private key file and passphrase.
* __Password__ — uses simple password authentication.
* __SSH-Agent__ — uses SSH agent for authentication, where the [SSH-Agent build feature](ssh-agent.md) must be enabled.

<note>

The current secure connection implementation accepts _any_ certificate provided by the remote host. No trust checks are performed!

Paths to sources

</td>

<td>

Specify the deployment sources as a newline- or comma-separated list of paths to files/directories.

The field supports [Ant-style wildcard patterns](wildcards.md#Antlike+Wildcards) (for example, `dir/**/*.zip`).   
You can also specify a target directory to be created using the `file => directory` pattern (for example, `*.zip => winFiles,unix/distro.tgz => linuxFiles` will create the `winFiles` and `linuxFiles` directories, and respectively put the declared files inside them).

### Example

For example, consider the case where you need to add an SSH Upload build step to upload Java packages to an SSH server (on the `ssh.example.com` host). Suppose you use the `jdoe` account on the SSH server with the home directory `/jdoe`, and the SSH server is configured to use SSH keys for authentication.

1. Follow the steps in [Generated SSH Keys](ssh-keys-management.md#Generated+SSH+Keys) to generate a new SSH key pair in your project. Call the key pair `PackageUploadKey`.
2. Copy the public key from the `PackageUploadKey` key pair.
3. Log in to the `jdoe` account on your SSH server and follow the instructions from your SSH server provider to add the `PackageUploadKey` public key to this account.
3. In your project's build configuration, go to the **Build Steps** page and click **Add build step**.
4. On the **New Build Step** page, select the **SSH Upload** runner.
5. On the **New Build Step: SSH Upload** page, fill in the fields, as follows:
   * **Step name** — Enter `UploadJavaPackages`
   * **Target** — Enter `ssh.example.com:/jdoe`
   * **Authentication method** — Select _Uploaded key_
   * **Username** — Enter `jdoe` (the username for the account on the SSH server)
   * **Select key** — Select `PackageUploadKey` from the dropdown list
   * **Paths to sources** — Enter the following paths:
      ```
      ch-simple/simple/target/*.jar => packages
      ```
6. Click **Save** to create the build step.
