### Security

23 security issues were fixed. To protect customers who have not yet updated their servers, we typically withhold details about these fixes. Instead, we encourage you to review our [Security Bulletin](https://www.jetbrains.com/privacy-security/issues-fixed/?product=TeamCity) a few days after each bugfix release for more information.

In our effort to enhance transparency and due to potential delays in publishing new security bulletins (stemming from the simultaneous release of the 2022.04.6, 2022.10.5, 2023.05.5, 2023.11.5, and 2024.03.2 bug-fix updates), we have decided to provide a summary of both new and backported fixes.
