A _build log_ is an enhanced console output of a build. It is represented by a structured list of the events which took place during the build. Generally, it includes entries on TeamCity-performed actions and the output of the processes launched during the build. TeamCity captures the processes output and stores it in an internal format that allows for hierarchical display.

## Viewing Build Log

The log of a specific build is available for browsing on the __[Build Results](build-results-page.md#Build+Log+Tab)__ page. 

The __Tree view__ is the most capable view provided in the web UI. By default, all messages are displayed. Using the _View_ drop-down menu, you can switch from all messages to viewing __errors__ separately, or you can choose __Important messages__ to see the log filtered by "error" and "warning" statuses. You can also use the "Verbose" view level and download a raw build log using the corresponding link.

>To switch to the dark theme in the build log, select the __Use console view__ option.

You can download a full build log in the textual form or as a `.zip` archive  from the Build Results page by clicking the _Download full build log_ link in the upper right corner.

## Integration with Log Analysis Tools

If you want 3rd-party log analysis tools to ingest logs generated by TeamCity builds, set up the integration that targets the following URL:

* `http(s)://<Server_URL>/downloadBuildLog.html?buildId=<id>` — if your log analysis tool authenticates in TeamCity using an [access token](configuring-your-user-profile.md#Managing+Access+Tokens).
* `http(s)://<Server_URL>/httpAuth/downloadBuildLog.html?buildId=<id>` — if the tool authenticates using the standard username/password credentials.

For example, a request to the following URL will result in downloading a log for a build whose internal ID is "4102":

```Shell
http://localhost:8111/downloadBuildLog.html?buildId=4102
```

Note that build IDs are not equal to build numbers. You can obtain IDs from the payload returned by the following REST API request that [returns all finished builds](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest/get-build-details.html):

```Shell
/app/rest/builds
```
{prompt="GET"}

To get builds of the specific configuration only, add the corresponding [locator](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest/locators.html) to your endpoint:

```Shell
/app/rest/builds?locator=buildType:ProjectName_ConfigName
```
{prompt="GET"}

### Additional URL Parameters

#### Download Plain Log

Add the `plain=true` parameter to download plain build log directly. For example:

```Shell
http://localhost:8111/downloadBuildLog.html?buildId=4102&plain=true
```

#### Download Archived Log

Add the `archived=true` parameter to the URL to download the target log file as a `.zip` archive. For example:

```Shell
http://localhost:8111/downloadBuildLog.html?buildId=4102&archived=true
```

#### Download Raw Log Files

Replace `downloadBuildLog` with `downloadRawMessageFile` to download the `.raw.zip` archive that contains build log files in internal TeamCity format. You can download these files using the **Download log | Raw message files** action in TeamCity UI.

For example:

```Shell
http://localhost:8111/downloadRawMessageFile.html?buildId=4102
```

#### Modify the DateTime Pattern

By default, timestamps in a build log are written in the "HH:mm:ss" format. You can add the `dateFormat=<value>` parameter to the URL to modify the DateTime pattern. Custom patterns must follow the [Java SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html) specification.

For example:

```Shell
http://localhost:8111/downloadBuildLog.html?buildId=4102&dateFormat=yyyy-MM-dd%\20HH%3Amm%\3Ass%20zz
```

## Customizing Log Output

You can modify the log output using [service messages](service-messages.md#Reporting+Messages+to+Build+Log). This includes grouping the log entries in blocks, handling parallel message flows, changing the severity of a log message, and so on.

## Build Log Size

It is recommended to keep the build log small and tune build scripts not to print too much into the output. Large build logs are hard to view in the browser and are loading TeamCity infrastructure piping build messages from the agent to the server while the build is running.

It is recommended to print into the output only the messages required to understand the build progress and build failures. The rest of the information should be streamed into a log file and the file should be published as a build artifact. A "good" build log size is megabytes at most.

### Partial Build Log Display

When opening large build logs, TeamCity displays a part of it to avoid browser hanging. You can view the full build log on clicking the corresponding link.

The display threshold is set to 5M characters by default and can be adjusted using the `teamcity.buildLog.sizeThreshold.chars` [internal property](server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+Internal+Properties) (not applicable to running build logs and logs links with states (for example, direct links to messages).

## ANSI-style Coloring in Build Log

TeamCity build logs render clickable hyperlinks and support ANSI-style escape color codes by default: if your tool produces a colored console output, you will see in the build log in TeamCity. See the related feature request for the [full list of supported sequences](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-23760#comment=27-1021150).

To disable the coloring, set the `teamcity.buildLog.ansiColoring.enabled=false` [internal property](server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+Internal+Properties).
