TeamCity comes bundled with the [Amazon S3 Artifact Storage](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9623-aws-s3-artifact-storage) plugin which allows storing build artifacts in an Amazon S3 bucket.

It is possible to replace the TeamCity built-in artifacts' storage with [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) at a project level. When an S3 artifacts storage is configured, it:
* allows uploading to, downloading, and removing artifacts from S3;
* handles resolution of artifact dependencies as well as clean-up of artifacts;
* displays artifacts located externally in the TeamCity UI.

## Configuring Amazon S3 Artifacts Storage
{id="configuring-amazon-s3-artifacts-storage"}

To enable an external artifact storage in an AWS S3 bucket:
1. Open __Project Settings | Artifacts Storage__. The built-in TeamCity artifacts storage is displayed by default and marked as active.
2. Click __Add new storage__. Select _S3 Storage_ as the storage type. 
3. [__Storage ID__](identifier.md) is filled out automatically. You can modify it with your own unique ID.
4. Enter an optional name for your storage.
5. Select the AWS environment and provide the required settings.
6. Provide your AWS security credentials.
7. Specify an existing S3 bucket to store artifacts.
8. Save your settings.

The configured S3 storage will appear on the __Artifacts Storage__ page. To enable it in this project, change its state to _Active_.

Now, new artifacts produced by builds of this project and its subprojects will be stored in the specified AWS S3 bucket.

<anchor name="pathPrefix"/>

## Path Prefix

You can set an S3 [path prefix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/using-folders.html). This allows using the same S3 bucket for all TeamCity projects and configure prefix-based permissions.

<anchor name="forceVirtualHostAddressing"/>

## Virtual Host Addressing

You can enable the virtual host addressing for S3 buckets. Currently, both hosted-style and path-style requests are supported by TeamCity. Note that Amazon [stopped supporting path-style access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#path-style-access) for new buckets since September 2020.

<!-- 
## Transfer Acceleration

<anchor name="transferAcceleration"/>

You can enable transfer acceleration for uploads and downloads if the following requirements are met:

* Transfer acceleration can only be enabled together with **virtual host addressing**. It does not work with path-style requests.
* You need to enable transfer acceleration on your S3 bucket.
* You bucket name must be DNS-compliant and must not contain periods `.`

When the "_Transfer Acceleration_" option is enabled, the provided AWS credentials or IAM role on the TeamCity server should have the `GetAccelerateConfiguration` permission. 

For more information see [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html)
-->

## Permissions

When the "_Use Pre-Signed URLs for upload_" option is enabled, the provided AWS credentials or IAM role on the TeamCity server should have permissions: `DeleteObject, ListAllMyBuckets, GetBucketLocation, GetObject, ListBucket, PutObject`.

When the "Use Pre-Signed URLs for upload" option is disabled:
* the provided AWS credentials or IAM role on the TeamCity server should have permissions: `DeleteObject, ListAllMyBuckets, GetBucketLocation, GetObject`
* either AWS credentials should be specified and have `ListBucket, PutObject` permissions, or IAM role on all the TeamCity agents should have permissions: `ListBucket, PutObject`

## Multipart Upload
<anchor name="multipartUpload"/>

To optimize the [upload of large files](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-upload-large-files/) to [Amazon S3](storing-build-artifacts-in-amazon-s3.md), you can initiate [multipart upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html) instead of regular upload. To do this, set the multipart upload threshold in the _Connection Settings_ block. The minimum allowed value is `5MB`. Supported suffixes: `KB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB`. If you leave this field empty, multipart upload will be initiated automatically for all files larger than 8 MB (`8MB` is the default value).

Additionally, you can configure the maximum allowed size of each uploaded file part. The minimum value is `5MB`. If left empty, TeamCity will use `8MB` as the default value.

>We recommend that you configure a [bucket lifecycle policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config.html) to prevent incomplete multipart uploads.

## Transferring Artifacts via CloudFront
{id="CloudFrontSettings" auxiliary-id="CloudFrontSettings"}

[Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) is a content delivery network that offers low latency and high transfer speeds. Enabling its support for an S3 storage will allow TeamCity to transfer artifacts through the closest CloudFront server. If your S3 bucket is located in a different region than your TeamCity infrastructure, this could significantly speed up the artifacts' upload/download and reduce expenses.

>If you use [EC2 build agents](setting-up-teamcity-for-amazon-ec2.md) located in the same region as the target S3 bucket, these agents will communicate with the bucket directly, omitting CloudFront.

### Prerequisites

TeamCity can [set up CloudFront integration for you](#Automatic+CloudFront+Setup), or you can set up all the settings [manually](#Manual+CloudFront+Setup).

The CloudFront integration requires configuring:
* an [OAI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html) user
* two [CloudFront distributions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-working-with.html), one for uploading and downloading artifacts.
* a [trusted key group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#choosing-key-groups-or-AWS-accounts)
* an SSH-2 RSA [key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#private-content-creating-cloudfront-key-pairs) (public key + private key) in PEM format

### CloudFront Settings

To enable the CloudFront support for the current S3 bucket, activate the _Use CloudFront to transport artifacts_ option in the storage settings.

In each of the dropdowns, _Distribution for uploads_ and _Distribution for downloads_, choose an available distribution 
if it was [manually created](#Manual+CloudFront+Setup) in your Amazon profile, 
or click <img src="magic-wand.png" alt="Switch to the Sakura UI" height="20" width="20"/> to _[configure settings automatically](#Automatic+CloudFront+Setup)_.

For Cloudfront settings to work properly TeamCity needs new permissions:

* cloudfront:ListDistributions
* cloudfront:ListKeyGroups
* cloudfront:ListPublicKeys

#### Automatic CloudFront Setup

TeamCity can configure the settings automatically. This involves:
* Generating a key pair and uploading a public key to CloudFront.
* Creating a new key group in CloudFront.
* Creating two new distributions with:
  * the __Use all edge locations__ price class.
  * a new [Origin Access Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html) that can access the current bucket.
  * the default behaviour defining
      * allowed HTTP methods for uploading artifacts: `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, for downloading: `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`;
      * a new [key group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#private-content-adding-trusted-signers) with the viewer access;
      * a custom [cache policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) that allows passing all query strings.
* Adding a new policy to an S3 bucket to allow the new distributions access to it. See the [policy example](#S3+Policy+Example).

Automatic setup requires giving Teamcity additional permissions:

* cloudfront:CreateDistribution
* cloudfront:CreateKeyGroup
* cloudfront:CreatePublicKey
* cloudfront:CreateOriginRequestPolicy
* cloudfront:CreateCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity
* cloudfront:CreateCachePolicy
* cloudfront:DeleteKeyGroup
* cloudfront:DeletePublicKey
* cloudfront:ListCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentities
* cloudfront:ListCachePolicies
* cloudfront:ListOriginRequestPolicies
* cloudfront:GetDistribution
* cloudfront:GetPublicKey
* s3:GetBucketPolicy
* s3:PutBucketPolicy

Example policy providing all necessary permissions:

```Plain Text
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudfront:CreatePublicKey",
                "cloudfront:CreateOriginRequestPolicy",
                "cloudfront:ListCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentities",
                "cloudfront:DeleteKeyGroup",
                "cloudfront:GetPublicKey",
                "cloudfront:ListCachePolicies",
                "cloudfront:CreateDistribution",
                "cloudfront:ListOriginRequestPolicies",
                "cloudfront:DeletePublicKey",
                "cloudfront:CreateCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity",
                "cloudfront:CreateKeyGroup",
                "cloudfront:CreateCachePolicy",
                "cloudfront:GetDistribution",
                "cloudfront:ListPublicKeys",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "cloudfront:ListKeyGroups",
                "cloudfront:ListDistributions"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "2",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
                "s3:GetBucketPolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>"
        }
    ]
}

```

#### Manual CloudFront Setup

For security reasons, we recommend configuring two separate distributions for uploading and downloading artifacts. For each distribution:
1. Generate a key pair in [SSH-2 RSA key format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#private-content-creating-cloudfront-key-pairs).
2. Upload the public key from the pair to CloudFront.
3. [Add a new key group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#private-content-adding-trusted-signers) in CloudFront and add the created public key to this group.
4. Create a new cache policy with __Cache key settings | Query strings__ set to _All_.
5. If you use a private bucket, create a new [OAI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html) user.
6. [Create a distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-creating.html) and attach your key group to it:
   * Make sure to choose the same S3 bucket as specified in TeamCity.
   * __Allowed HTTP methods__ for uploading artifacts `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`; for downloading `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS` 
   * __Restrict viewer access__: _yes_
   * __Trusted authorization type__: _trusted key groups_
   * __Cache key and origin requests__: _Cache policy and origin request policy_
   * For private buckets, enable the _use OAI_ option and configure OAI with the following setting:
     * __Bucket policy__: _No, I will update the bucket policy_
   * For public buckets, disable the __Block public access__ option.
7. [Add a new policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/add-bucket-policy.html) to your S3 bucket. See the [policy example](#S3+Policy+Example).

When configured, the distributions should automatically appear in the _Distribution for uploads_  and _Distribution for downloads_ drop-down menus.
1. Select the target CloudFront distribution.
2. In _CloudFront public key_, select the public key associated with this distribution.
3. In _Private SSH key_, upload the private key from the pair.
4. Save the storage settings.

#### S3 Policy Example

For accessing a private bucket with OAI:

```Plain Text
{
"Sid": "1",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity <OAI ID"
  },
  "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:PutObject",
      "s3:DeleteObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<S3 bucket name/*"
}
```

For accessing a public bucket:

```Plain Text
{
"Sid": "PublicRead",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": "*",
  "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion"
    ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3::<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
}
```
