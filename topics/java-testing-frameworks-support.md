TeamCity supports JUnit and TestNG by means of following build runners:

* [Gradle](gradle.md)
* [Ant](ant.md) (when tests are run by JUnit and testng tasks directly within the script)
* [Maven](maven.md) (when tests are run by Surefire/Failsafe Maven plugins, on-the-fly reporting is not available)
* [IntelliJ IDEA Project](intellij-idea-project.md): IntelliJ IDEA's JUnit and TestNG run configurations are supported. Note that such run configurations should be shared and checked in to the version control.

See the following help article for the information about supported JUnit and TestNG versions: [Supported Platforms and Environments](supported-platforms-and-environments.md#Testing+Frameworks).
