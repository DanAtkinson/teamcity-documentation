TeamCity provides out-of-the-box support for a number of testing frameworks. In order to reduce feedback time on the test failures, TeamCity provides support for on-the-fly tests reporting where possible. On-the-fly tests reporting means that the tests are reported in the TeamCity UI as soon as they are run, not waiting for the build to complete.

## Supported Testing Frameworks

TeamCity directly supports the following _testing frameworks_:
* JUnit and TestNG for the following runners:
  * [Gradle](gradle.md)
  * [Ant](ant.md) (when tests are run by the `junit` and `testng` tasks directly within the script, TeamCity reports tests on the fly)
  * [Maven2](maven.md) (when tests are run by [Maven Surefire plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin/) or [Maven Failsafe plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/integration-test-mojo.html), tests reporting occurs after each module test run finish)
  * [IntelliJ IDEA Project](intellij-idea-project.md) project (when run with appropriate IDEA run configurations. Note that such run configurations should be shared in the IDE and related files should be checked in to the version control)
* [NUnit](nunit-support.md) for the following runners:
  * [.NET](net.md) (the `test` task)
  * [NAnt](nant.md) (the `nunit2` task)
  * Runners deprecated in favor of the .NET runner, but supported for compatibility: [MSBuild](msbuild.md) ([NUnit community](nunit.md) or [NUnitTeamCity](nunit-support.md#Using+NUnit+for+MSBuild) tasks), [Microsoft Visual Studio Solution](visual-studio-sln.md)
  * Any other runner, provided that the [TeamCity add-in for NUnit](nunit-support.md#TeamCity+Add-in+for+NUnit) is installed
* [MSTest](mstest-support.md) 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015 (On-the-fly reporting is not available due to MSTest limitations)
* VSTest in the [.NET](net.md) and (deprecated) [VSTest](visual-studio-tests.md) runners
* [MSpec](mspec.md)
* [Pytest](python.md)
* [Node.js](nodejs.md): ESlint, Jest, and Mocha.
* Ruby:
  * The [Rake](rake.md) runner supports [Test::Unit](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html), [Test-Spec](http://search.cpan.org/~philip/Test-Spec-0.48/lib/Test/Spec.pm), [Shoulda](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda), [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), [Cucumber](http://cukes.info).
  * The [minitest](https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest) framework requires the `minitest-reporters` gem to be additionally installed.

There are also testing frameworks that have embedded support for TeamCity on their side: for example, [Gallio](net-testing-frameworks-support.md#Gallio) and [xUnit](net-testing-frameworks-support.md#xUnit).

See also external [plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/teamcity). 

You can import test run XML reports of supported formats with [XML Report Processing](xml-report-processing.md).

## Custom Testing Frameworks

If there is no TeamCity support yet for your testing framework, you can report tests progress to TeamCity from the build via [service messages](service-messages.md#Reporting+Tests) or generate one of the supported [XML reports](xml-report-processing.md) in the build.

See [notes](how-to.md#Integrate+with+Build+and+Reporting+Tools) on integrating with various reporting/metric tools.
